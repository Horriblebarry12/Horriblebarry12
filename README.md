idk why I have a github but I do anyway so yah

I mostly code in C# (for unity), python (for random scripts), and c++ (for my aduino)

Also cuz I also know some java I can definitely tell you that C# is better

Another thing: I learned to code off youtube so im not the best. 
But thats fine as im not even in highschool as of the time writing this.
